# StNet
This git holds the architecture of the network exposed in this paper: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1811.01549.pdf

It felt very inspired, but the team didn't release their code. I'm not among the authors but I felt eager to test it so I designed it following the instructions released in the paper. The actual implementation might differ.

This work is largely inspired by those codes :

### Squeeze and Excite Resnet

### Traditionnal Resnet

### Xception
